This is the result of cutting out a module from a PDF, running it through https://go4convert.com/pdf-to-word and importing it into GDocs: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FnTmaHFOrA1SJr-XFdZKYREme1EFojMt/view

Some things to note: 

- Boxed elements are converted to a Drawing (to preserve styling) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/253202/70069697-ce25be80-15b7-11ea-9205-de2b8040b8fb.png)
- Some math is not converted ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/253202/70069656-bd754880-15b7-11ea-85c2-0503dc439bcc.png)
- Vector images have alignment problems ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/253202/70069796-ff9e8a00-15b7-11ea-9d68-f8bd270f7c02.png)
- Alt text is not on the images but that might be because our PDFs do not have alt text
